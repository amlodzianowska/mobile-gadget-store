# **Full-Stack E-Commerce Mobile App**  

I'm following a tutorial to build a **complete e-commerce platform** using **React Native, Supabase, Stripe, and Next.js**. The project focuses on **native mobile app development**, integrating secure authentication, payments, real-time updates, and an admin panel for product management. My goal is to apply these skills to future projects and strengthen my full-stack development expertise.  

## **What I'm Using**  
- **React Native & Expo** – Simplifying cross-platform mobile app development  
- **Expo Router** – Managing navigation with file-based routing  
- **Zustand** – Lightweight state management for cart functionality  
- **Supabase** – Handling authentication, database management & real-time updates  
- **Next.js** – Building the admin panel with API routes & role-based access  
- **Stripe** – Implementing secure checkout & payment processing  
- **EAS (Expo Application Services)** – Adding push notifications for real-time updates  
- **Vercel** – Deploying the admin panel & ensuring production readiness
