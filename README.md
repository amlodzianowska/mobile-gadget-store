Full-Stack E-Commerce Mobile App
I'm building a full-featured e-commerce mobile app using React Native, Supabase, Stripe, and Next.js. This project covers everything from front-end design to back-end management, payments, and deployment. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with native mobile development while implementing real-world features like authentication, payments, and push notifications.

What I'm Using
React Native & Expo – Simplifying cross-platform mobile app development
Expo Router – Managing navigation with file-based routing
Zustand – Lightweight state management for cart functionality
Supabase – Open-source Firebase alternative for authentication & database management
Next.js – Building an admin panel with API routes & role-based access
Stripe – Handling secure payment processing
EAS (Expo Application Services) – Implementing real-time push notifications
Vercel – Deploying the admin panel & ensuring production readiness
